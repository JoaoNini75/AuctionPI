An auction Rest API built with Spring Boot, Java 17 and PostgreSQL.

Based on my college (FCT - UNL) Cloud Computing Systems course (project 1 - 2022/23 edition). 

The API has (or will have) the following entities: 
- Users
- Media
- Auctions
- Bids
- Questions/Replies


Besides the CRUD operations for all of the entities, the service provides endpoints for the following queries:
- List of bids of a given auction;
- List of bids of a given user;
- List of auctions about to close;
- List of auctions that a given user created;
- List of auctions that a given user bid on;
- List of questions of a given auction.
